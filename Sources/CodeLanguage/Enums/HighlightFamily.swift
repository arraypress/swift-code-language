/// This is a *coarse* grouping used to drive fallback highlighting: a syntax
/// highlighter that has no dedicated grammar for a given ``Language`` can pick a
/// reasonable rule set from its family (e.g. every `cLike` language shares `//`
/// and `/* */` comments, braces, and C-style keywords). It is deliberately not a
/// precise classification — many languages only approximately fit their family.

    /// `#`-commented, `def`/`end`-style languages (Ruby, Crystal, Elixir…).
